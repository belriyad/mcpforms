# üî¥ E2E Test Execution Report - BLOCKED

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Test Run**: Complete E2E Workflow Through Document Generation  
**Result**: ‚ùå **BLOCKED - Cannot Proceed Past Login**  
**Progress**: 0/9 Steps Completed (0%)

---

## Executive Summary

The E2E test is **completely blocked** at the login step and cannot proceed to test document generation. The authentication system is rejecting the provided credentials (`belal.riyad@gmail.com` / `9920032`), showing a "Failed to sign in" error message.

**Critical Impact**: Cannot validate the recently deployed field normalization fix that was intended to solve the intake-data-to-document issue.

## üö® Blocking Issue

### **ISSUE #1: Authentication Failure - LOGIN BLOCKED**

**Severity**: üî¥ P0 CRITICAL - Blocks all testing  
**Component**: Firebase Authentication / Login Page  
**Status**: ‚ùå FAILING

#### Evidence
```
Error Message on Page: "Failed to sign in"
Current URL After Attempt: https://formgenai-4545.web.app/login/
Expected URL: https://formgenai-4545.web.app/admin
Wait Time: 15 seconds (timeout)
```

#### Credentials Used
```
Email: belal.riyad@gmail.com
Password: 9920032
Source: User-provided credentials
```

#### Screenshots Generated
- ‚úÖ `test-results/e2e-03-login-filled.png` - Shows form filled
- ‚úÖ `test-results/e2e-error-login.png` - Shows "Failed to sign in" error
- ‚úÖ Video recording of entire failed attempt

#### Possible Causes
1. **Incorrect Password** - Password may have been changed or is incorrect
2. **Account Doesn't Exist** - Email may not be registered in Firebase Auth
3. **Account Disabled** - Account may be locked/disabled in Firebase Console
4. **Email Not Verified** - System may require email verification
5. **Firebase Auth Rules** - Auth may be rejecting login for security reasons
6. **Environment Mismatch** - Credentials may be for different environment

## üìã TODO Checklist - Must Complete Before Testing Can Continue

### Priority 1: Resolve Authentication (CRITICAL)

- [ ] **TODO #1**: Manually verify login at https://formgenai-4545.web.app/login
  - Try logging in with: `belal.riyad@gmail.com` / `9920032`
  - Document if successful or what error appears
  - Screenshot the result

- [ ] **TODO #2**: Check Firebase Console for user status
  - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/formgenai-4545/authentication/users
  - Search for: `belal.riyad@gmail.com`
  - Verify:
    - ‚úì User exists
    - ‚úì Email is verified
    - ‚úì Account is enabled (not disabled)
    - ‚úì No locks or restrictions

- [ ] **TODO #3**: Attempt password reset if credentials incorrect
  - Use "Forgot Password" on login page
  - Set known password
  - Update `.env.test` with new password
  - Re-run test

- [ ] **TODO #4**: Create dedicated test account if needed
  - Create: `e2e-test@mcpforms.test` or similar

  - Download generated document(s)
  - **Manually inspect documents for filled placeholders**
  - **Verify all form data appears in document**
  - **Confirm field normalization fix works**
  - Screenshot generation success
  - Document any missing/empty fields

### Priority 3: Validate Field Normalization Fix

- [ ] **TODO #15**: Verify clientData in Firestore
  - Check intake document in Firestore
  - Confirm clientData has fields in camelCase
  - Example: `{ trustName: "...", grantorNames: "..." }`

- [ ] **TODO #16**: Check Firebase Function Logs
  - View logs for `generateDocumentsFromIntake` function
  - Look for normalization log messages:
    ```
    üîÑ [AI-GEN] Field normalization applied:
       Original (camelCase): trustName, grantorNames, ...
       Normalized (snake_case): trust_name, grantor_names, ...
    ```

- [ ] **TODO #17**: Download and Inspect Generated Document
  - Open generated document in Word/PDF reader
  - Check each placeholder:
    - ‚úì Trust name filled?
    - ‚úì Grantor names filled?
    - ‚úì Dates filled?
    - ‚úì Notary info filled?
    - ‚úì County filled?
  - Document fill rate: __% of fields populated

- [ ] **TODO #18**: Compare Before/After Fix
  - If possible, find old generated document (before fix)
  - Compare to new document (after fix)
  - Document improvement in field population

## üéØ Testing Objectives (Once Unblocked)

### Primary Objective ‚≠ê
**Validate Field Normalization Fix**: Verify that intake form data (stored in camelCase) is correctly normalized to snake_case and appears in generated documents.

**Success Criteria**:
- All intake form fields appear in generated documents
- No empty placeholders in documents
- Field normalization logs show in Firebase Functions
- Document fill rate: ‚â•95% of fields populated

### Secondary Objectives
- Verify complete E2E workflow functions
- Identify any breaking issues in the flow
- Test AI field extraction quality
- Validate intake form submission process
- Document any UX/UI issues encountered

---

## üîß Technical Context

### Recent Deployment
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Fix Deployed**: Field name normalization (camelCase ‚Üí snake_case)  
**Files Modified**:
- ‚úÖ `functions/src/utils/fieldNormalizer.ts` (NEW)
- ‚úÖ `functions/src/services/documentGeneratorAI.ts` (MODIFIED)

**Deployment Status**: ‚úÖ All 45 Firebase functions deployed successfully

### What Was Fixed
**Problem**: Intake form data wasn't appearing in generated documents  
**Root Cause**: Field name format mismatch
- Forms used: `trustName` (camelCase)
- AI expected: `trust_name` (snake_case)

**Solution**: Normalize field names before sending to OpenAI

**Expected Result**: All form fields should now appear in documents

### What This Test Should Prove
1. ‚úÖ Field normalization utility works correctly
2. ‚úÖ camelCase ‚Üí snake_case conversion is applied
3. ‚úÖ OpenAI receives properly formatted field names
4. ‚úÖ Generated documents have all placeholders filled
5. ‚úÖ No regressions in other parts of the workflow

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Test Cannot Proceed**: All testing is blocked until login issue resolved
2. **Primary Goal Unreachable**: Cannot validate document generation fix
3. **Time Sensitive**: Fix was just deployed, need to verify it works
4. **Manual Testing Alternative**: Can manually test workflow through UI if automated test continues to fail

---

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è **ON HOLD - AWAITING AUTH FIX**  
**Next Update**: After login credentials are verified/fixed  
**Estimated Time to Unblock**: 5-15 minutes (credential verification)  
**Estimated Time for Full Test**: 5-10 minutes (once unblocked)
