## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure:
```typescript
clientResponse: {
  responses: {
    [fieldName]: value
  },
  status: 'in_progress' | 'submitted',
  submittedAt: Timestamp,
  lastEditedAt: Timestamp,  // NEW
  editedBy: string          // NEW
}
```

### Firestore Updates:
```typescript
await updateDoc(serviceRef, {
  'clientResponse.responses': responses,
  'clientResponse.lastEditedAt': serverTimestamp(),
  'clientResponse.editedBy': 'admin',
  updatedAt: serverTimestamp()
})
```

### Real-time Sync:

## Security Considerations

### Current:
- ✅ Firebase Authentication required
- ✅ Firestore security rules enforce access
- ✅ Client-side validation
- ✅ Server-side data integrity

### To Implement:
- ⏳ User role checking (verify lawyer owns service)
- ⏳ Audit log for all edits
- ⏳ Change history tracking
- ⏳ Undo capability
- ⏳ Version control for responses

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open service with submitted responses

## Known Limitations

3. **Single User Edit**: No conflict resolution for concurrent edits
4. **No Audit Trail UI**: Edits tracked but not displayed
5. **Basic Validation**: Only required field checking

---

## Future Enhancements
