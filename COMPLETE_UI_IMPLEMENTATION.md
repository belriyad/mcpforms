## 🚀 How to Deploy

The code is ready to deploy. To complete the deployment:

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/rubazayed/MCPForms/mcpforms

# 2. Build the project (if not already done)
npm run build

# 3. Deploy to Firebase
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
npx firebase-tools deploy --only hosting --non-interactive

# Note: The deployment may take 5-10 minutes due to:
# - Building Next.js application (22 routes)
# - Creating Cloud Function (98.68 MB)
# - Uploading hosting files (~55 files)
# - Updating Cloud Run service
```

### Expected Deployment Output:
```
