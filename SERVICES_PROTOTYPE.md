## üéØ User Flow Demonstration

### Scenario: Lawyer Creates Will Preparation Service

1. **Navigate to Services**
   - Click "Services" tab in admin dashboard
   - OR click "Try New Service Flow" banner in old service manager

2. **Create Service**
   - Click "+ New Service" button
   - Fill in: "Will Preparation", "John Doe", "john@example.com"
   - Click "Next"

3. **Select Templates**
   - Select: Will Template, Agency Contract, Disclaimer Agreement
   - See: "3 templates selected (28 total fields)"
   - Click "Next"

4. **Customize (Prototype)**
   - See AI assistant for each template
   - Try entering: "Add clause to donate 50% of assets to charity"
   - Note: This step shows UI only (click Next to continue)

5. **Review**
   - See unified form: "28 fields merged into 18 unique (10 duplicates)"
   - Review common fields (Name, DOB, Address) used across templates
   - Review template-specific fields
   - Click "Create & Send to Client"

6. **Service Created**
   - Redirected to service details page
   - See templates section with selected templates

## üîß What's Functional vs Mockup

### ‚úÖ Fully Functional (Interactive Prototype)
- Navigation between all pages
- Multi-step wizard with validation
- Template multi-selection with real-time stats
- Status filtering
- Visual state transitions
- Responsive design

### üé® Mockup/Placeholder (Not Connected)
- AI clause generation (UI only, no OpenAI call)
- Intake form actual content (shows structure only)
- Document generation (no real document creation)
- Client response data (mock data)
- Email sending (simulated with alerts)

## üìä Mock Data

The prototype includes:
- **3 sample services** with different statuses
- **4 sample templates** (Will, Agency Contract, Disclaimer, Employment)
- **Realistic field counts** and statistics
- **Sample client information**

## üöÄ Next Steps for Full Implementation

### Phase 1: Data Layer
- Create new Firestore schema for unified services
- Migration script for existing services
- Update cloud functions for new structure

### Phase 2: AI Integration
- Implement real AI clause generation per template
- Field extraction and deduplication algorithm
- Unified intake form generator

### Phase 3: Document Generation
- Implement document population from intake data
- Merge AI-generated sections
- Generate multiple documents as ZIP

### Phase 4: Client Portal
- Email integration for intake link
- Client intake form page
- Submission notifications

## üé® Design System

### Colors
- **Blue/Indigo Gradient:** Primary actions, services
- **Purple/Pink Gradient:** AI features
- **Green/Emerald Gradient:** Success states, document generation
- **Yellow/Orange:** Warnings, pending states
- **Gray:** Neutral, inactive states

### Key Components
- Progress stepper with icons
- Status badges with icons
- Gradient cards for statistics
- Bordered sections for organization
- Hover states with scale transforms

## üì± Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- Responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Scrollable tables on small screens

## üß™ Testing the Prototype

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to:
- `/admin/services` - Services dashboard
- `/admin/services/create` - Creation wizard
- `/admin/services/service_1` - Example service detail

### Production
Already deployed at: https://formgenai-4545.web.app

## üí° Key UX Improvements Over Current System

1. **Guided Workflow:** Step-by-step wizard eliminates confusion
2. **Visual Progress:** Always know where you are in the process
3. **Smart Merging:** Automatic field deduplication (no manual work)
4. **Contextual AI:** AI assistance appears where needed (per template)
5. **Single Source of Truth:** Service page shows everything in one place
6. **Status Tracking:** Clear visual indicators of service state
7. **Action-Oriented:** Next steps always clear with prominent buttons
8. **Template Bundling:** Multiple templates per service (as per spec)

## üìù Feedback Points

When reviewing, consider:
1. **Flow intuition:** Does the 4-step process make sense?
2. **Information hierarchy:** Is important info prominent?
3. **Visual design:** Are colors/spacing/typography clear?
4. **Missing features:** What else would make this more useful?
5. **Confusing elements:** Anything unclear or misleading?

## üîÑ Iteration Plan

Based on your feedback, we can:
- Adjust step order or content
- Add/remove information from pages
- Change visual design elements
- Modify terminology/labels
- Adjust button placements
- Add more preview/help content
