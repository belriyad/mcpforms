**What Was Wrong**:
- Complex interface with confusing tabs ("Overrides", "Create Override", "AI Clause Generator", "Effective Schema")

✅ **Immediate feedback** - Toast notifications for every action  

### Issue 2: Old and New Design Mixed ❌ → ✅
**Your Concern**: "the old design and new design are still showing in the same page"

**What Was Wrong**:
- Inconsistent styling across pages
- Mixed design patterns
- Some pages had new design, others had old

**What We Fixed**:
✅ **Unified design system** - All pages now follow same design language  
✅ **Consistent components** - Same buttons, cards, headers everywhere
