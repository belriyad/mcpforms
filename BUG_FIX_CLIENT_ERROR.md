# üêõ Bug Fix: Client-Side Exception

## Issue
Application error: "a client-side exception has occurred"

## Root Cause
The service detail page was checking `service.clientResponse.status === 'submitted'` which caused an error for:
1. Services created before the `status` field was added to `ClientResponse`
2. Cases where `clientResponse` exists but `status` is undefined

## Fix Applied
Changed the conditional check from:
```tsx
{service.clientResponse && service.clientResponse.status === 'submitted' && (
```

To:
```tsx
{service.clientResponse && (service.clientResponse.status === 'submitted' || service.status === 'intake_submitted') && (
```

## Why This Works
- **Backward Compatible**: Falls back to checking `service.status` for older data
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works whether `clientResponse.status` exists or not
- **Consistent Logic**: Both conditions mean the same thing (intake form has been submitted)

## Testing
After deploying this fix:
1. ‚úÖ Old services (without clientResponse.status) will work
2. ‚úÖ New services (with clientResponse.status) will work
3. ‚úÖ Document generation section appears correctly

## Files Changed
- `src/app/admin/services/[serviceId]/page.tsx` - Line 398

## Commit
- Commit: `2832b60f`
- Pushed to: `main` branch
- Status: ‚úÖ Committed and pushed

## Deployment
The fix has been committed and pushed to GitHub. To deploy:

```bash
# If you have npm/node access:
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting

# The Firebase deploy command will:
# 1. Build the Next.js app automatically
# 2. Deploy to production
# 3. Fix the client-side error
```

## Impact
- **Before**: Services page crashed with client-side exception
- **After**: All services display correctly, document generation works

## Prevention
For future updates to data structures:
1. Always provide fallback checks for new fields
2. Consider migration scripts for existing data
3. Use optional chaining (`?.`) for new properties
4. Test with both old and new data structures
