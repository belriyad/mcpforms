```tsx
{hasPermission('canManageUsers') && (

)}
```

## 🚀 Usage

### For Managers

#### 1. **Access User Management**
Navigate to: Settings → "Manage Team Members" button
OR directly: `/admin/settings/users`

#### 2. **Add Team Member**
1. Click "Add Team Member"
2. Enter email and name
3. Select permission preset (Full Access, Assistant, Viewer, Custom)
4. Optionally customize individual permissions
5. Check "Send invitation" to generate password reset link
6. Submit

#### 3. **Edit Team Member**
1. Click "Edit" button on any team member
2. Modify name or permissions
3. Toggle active status
4. Save changes

#### 4. **Delete Team Member**
1. Click "Delete" button
2. Confirm deletion
3. User is removed from both Auth and Firestore

### For Team Members

Team members see only what they have permission to access:
- Buttons/features they can't use are hidden
- Pages they can't access redirect to admin dashboard
- Clean, permission-aware UI

## 🔒 Security

### API Level
- All routes verify JWT token
- Check `canManageUsers` permission before any user management
- Verify manager owns the team member being modified
- Prevent self-deletion
- Prevent removing own `canManageUsers` permission

### Database Level
Firestore rules (to be added):
```javascript
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.managerId
              || request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

### UI Level
- Permission guards prevent unauthorized actions
- Real-time permission updates
- Logout required only for security reasons, not permission changes

- [ ] Verify allowed features work correctly
- [ ] Check document editor (AI buttons hidden if no permission)
- [ ] Verify services page (no "New Service" if no permission)
- [ ] Verify templates page (no "Upload" if no permission)

### Permission Update Tests

- [ ] Bulk operations (add multiple users, bulk permission updates)
- [ ] Transfer ownership (transfer team members to another manager)
- [ ] Permission templates (save custom presets)

## 📝 Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing users without permissions get full access (manager role)
- Firestore security rules should be updated after testing
- Migration script needed for existing production users

### Performance
- Real-time listener on user profile
- Minimal overhead (single document subscription)
- Permission checks are in-memory (no additional queries)

### Error Handling
- All API endpoints have proper error responses
- User-friendly error messages in UI
- Console logging for debugging
- Toast notifications for success/error states

## 🎓 Best Practices

1. **Always check permissions**: Before showing sensitive UI or allowing actions
2. **Use PermissionGuard**: For conditional rendering of buttons/sections
3. **Use hasPermission()**: For programmatic permission checks
4. **Test thoroughly**: Verify permission restrictions work as expected
5. **Document custom permissions**: If you create new features, add new permissions
6. **Keep presets updated**: Update presets when adding new permissions

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions about the user management system:
1. Check console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify Firebase Admin SDK is initialized
3. Ensure user has valid JWT token
4. Check Firestore security rules
5. Review permission configuration in Firebase Console
