## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix to Reach Document Generation)

### Issue #1: Service Creation Timeout/Hang ⏱️
**Priority**: 🔴 P0 BLOCKER  
**Status**: 🚫 BLOCKING all subsequent tests  
**Symptom**: After clicking "Create & Send" button, test waits indefinitely  

**Evidence**:
```
✅ Clicked: Create & Send button
⏳ Creating service and sending intake...
[TEST HANGS HERE - NO PROGRESS]
```

**Root Cause Hypotheses**:
1. **API Performance**: Backend service creation taking >30 seconds
2. **No Success Confirmation**: UI not showing clear "service created" message
3. **Race Condition**: Service created but test doesn't detect completion
4. **Firebase Function Cold Start**: Cloud function takes 20-30s on first call
5. **Missing Wait Logic**: Test needs to wait for specific element/URL change

**Impact**: 
- 🚫 Blocks 100% of test execution beyond Step 2
- 🚫 Cannot test Steps 3-9 (intake, submission, approval, **document generation**)
- 📊 Test coverage stuck at 22% (2/9 steps)

**Fix Strategy**:
- [ ] **Option A**: Increase timeout from current to 60s
- [ ] **Option B**: Wait for specific success indicator (URL change, modal, toast)
- [ ] **Option C**: Poll Firestore directly to check if service exists
- [ ] **Option D**: Add explicit success state to UI after service creation
- [ ] **Option E**: Warm up Firebase functions before test run

**Estimated Fix Time**: 1-2 hours

**Immediate Action**:
```typescript
// Current code (line ~300 in core-scenarios.spec.ts)
await safeClick(page, createButton, 'Create & Send button');
console.log('⏳ Creating service and sending intake...');

// PROPOSED FIX:
await safeClick(page, createButton, 'Create & Send button');
console.log('⏳ Creating service and sending intake...');

// Wait for URL change to service detail page OR success modal
await Promise.race([
  page.waitForURL(/\/admin\/services\/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/, { timeout: 60000 }),
  page.waitForSelector('text=/service created|successfully created/i', { timeout: 60000 }),
  page.waitForTimeout(60000) // Fallback timeout
]);

// Verify we're on service detail page
const currentUrl = page.url();
if (currentUrl.includes('/admin/services/')) {
  const serviceId = currentUrl.split('/').pop();
  console.log(`✅ Service created: ${serviceId}`);
  return serviceId;
} else {
  console.log('⚠️ Service may be created but URL did not change');
  // Try to extract from UI or Firestore
}
```

---

### Issue #2: Manual Test Interruptions 🛑
**Priority**: 🔴 P0 BLOCKER  
**Status**: 🚫 USER BEHAVIOR  
**Symptom**: Test manually stopped with Ctrl+C before completion

**Evidence**:
```
⏳ Creating service and sending intake...
^C
```

**Root Cause**: Test appears stuck, user loses patience and interrupts

**Impact**: 
- 🚫 Never completes full workflow
- 📊 Cannot validate Steps 7-9 (approval, **document generation**)
- 🎥 Video recording incomplete

**Fix Strategy**:
- [ ] Fix Issue #1 first (service creation timeout)
- [ ] Add progress indicators showing test is active
- [ ] Run test in CI/CD environment (no manual intervention)
- [ ] Set expectations: "Test takes 3-5 minutes, do not interrupt"

**Estimated Fix Time**: N/A (depends on Issue #1)

---

### Issue #3: No Service ID Captured 🔑
**Priority**: 🟡 P1 HIGH  
**Status**: ⚠️ DEPENDENCY for Steps 3-9  
**Symptom**: Test doesn't extract service ID after creation

**Evidence**: No log showing "Service ID: xxx" after wizard completion

**Root Cause**: 
1. Service creation incomplete (Issue #1)
2. No explicit ID extraction logic after "Create & Send"

**Impact**: 
- 🚫 Cannot navigate to service detail page
- 🚫 Cannot fetch intake token
- 🚫 Cannot test Steps 7-9 (which need service ID)

**Fix Strategy**:
- [ ] Extract service ID from URL after creation
- [ ] Store in test context for later steps
- [ ] Validate ID format (alphanumeric, 20 chars)

**Code Location**: Line ~330 in core-scenarios.spec.ts

**Proposed Fix**:
```typescript
// After service creation completes
await page.waitForURL(/\/admin\/services\/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/, { timeout: 60000 });
const serviceUrl = page.url();
const serviceId = serviceUrl.split('/services/')[1]?.split('?')[0];

if (!serviceId || serviceId.length < 10) {
  throw new Error(`Invalid service ID extracted: ${serviceId}`);
}

console.log(`✅ STEP 2 COMPLETE: Service ID: ${serviceId}`);
// Store for later use
```

**Estimated Fix Time**: 30 minutes

---

### Issue #4: No Intake Token Captured 🎫
**Priority**: 🟡 P1 HIGH  
**Status**: ⚠️ DEPENDENCY for Steps 4-6  
**Symptom**: Cannot open client intake form without token

**Root Cause**: Service creation incomplete (Issue #1)

**Impact**: 
- 🚫 Cannot test client-side intake form
- 🚫 Cannot test form submission
- 🚫 Blocks testing of Steps 4-9

**Fix Strategy**:
- [ ] After service creation, fetch intake token from Firestore
- [ ] Or extract from UI if displayed
- [ ] Or generate intake URL from service ID

**Code Location**: Line ~350 in core-scenarios.spec.ts

**Proposed Fix**:
```typescript
// Option 1: Extract from UI
const intakeLink = await page.locator('text=/intake link|form link/i')
  .locator('..') // parent
  .locator('input, a')
  .first();
const intakeUrl = await intakeLink.getAttribute('value') || await intakeLink.getAttribute('href');
const intakeToken = intakeUrl.split('token=')[1];

// Option 2: Construct from service ID (if pattern is known)
const intakeToken = `intake_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;

// Option 3: Query Firestore directly
// (requires admin SDK in test environment)

console.log(`✅ STEP 3 COMPLETE: Intake token: ${intakeToken}`);
```

**Estimated Fix Time**: 45 minutes

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### Issue #5: Unclear Service Creation Progress 📊
**Priority**: 🟡 P1 HIGH  
**Status**: ⚠️ UX/UI IMPROVEMENT  
**Symptom**: No visual feedback during 20-60s service creation

**Impact**: 
- User thinks test is stuck
- Leads to manual interruption (Issue #2)
- Poor test experience

**Fix Strategy**:
- [ ] Add loading spinner in UI
- [ ] Add progress messages ("Creating service...", "Generating intake form...", "Almost done...")
- [ ] Add percentage progress bar
- [ ] Show estimated time remaining

**UI Improvement** (not test code):
```tsx
// In service creation wizard
<button onClick={handleCreateService}>
  {isCreating ? (
    <>
      <Spinner />
      Creating service... {progress}%
    </>
  ) : (
    'Create & Send'
  )}
</button>
```

**Estimated Fix Time**: 1 hour (UI changes)

---

### Issue #6: No Intake Form Validation 📝
**Priority**: 🟡 P1 HIGH  
**Status**: ⚠️ NOT TESTED (Steps 5-6 never reached)

**Test Requirements**:
- [ ] Verify all 8 fields render (5 text, 2 date, 1 dropdown)
- [ ] Verify field labels match template
- [ ] Verify required field validation
- [ ] Test form submission success/failure

**Estimated Fix Time**: Already implemented in test code, just needs to run

---

### Issue #7: No Submission Confirmation Test ✉️
**Priority**: 🟡 P1 HIGH  
**Status**: ⚠️ NOT TESTED (Step 6 never reached)  
**Symptom**: Unknown if submission shows success message

**Note**: Timeout logic already fixed (5s → 15s), but never tested

**Test Requirements**:
- [ ] Verify success message appears
- [ ] Verify form clears or redirects
- [ ] Verify submission stored in Firestore

**Estimated Fix Time**: Already implemented in test code, just needs to run

---

### Issue #8: Admin Approval Flow Not Tested 👍
**Priority**: 🟡 P1 HIGH  
**Status**: ⚠️ NOT TESTED (Steps 7-8 never reached)  
**Symptom**: Unknown if admin can find and approve submitted intake

**Test Requirements**:
- [ ] Navigate back to service detail page
- [ ] Find submitted intake in list
- [ ] Click approve button
- [ ] Verify status changes to "approved"

**Estimated Fix Time**: Already implemented in test code, just needs to run

## 🟢 MEDIUM/LOW PRIORITY ISSUES

### Issue #11: Cold Start Performance ❄️
**Priority**: 🟢 P2 MEDIUM  
**Status**: ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUE  
**Symptom**: First page load takes 30+ seconds

**Fix Strategy**:
- [ ] Deploy Firebase functions with more memory (512MB)

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2 hours (infrastructure)

---

### Issue #12: No Test Data Cleanup 🧹
**Priority**: 🟢 P3 LOW  
**Status**: ⚠️ TECHNICAL DEBT  
**Symptom**: Test creates services but doesn't clean up

**Fix Strategy**:
- [ ] Add afterEach hook to delete test services
- [ ] Use test-specific service prefix
- [ ] Create separate test Firestore database

**Estimated Fix Time**: 1 hour

---

### Issue #13: Test Interrupted Before Video Complete 🎥
**Priority**: 🟢 P2 MEDIUM  
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL VIDEO CAPTURED  
**Symptom**: Video shows only Steps 1-2

**Video Location**: 
```
test-results/core-scenarios-Core-Scenar-47580-Approve-→-Generate-Document-chromium/video.webm
