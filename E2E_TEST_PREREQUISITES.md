# E2E Test Prerequisites - "Failed to Create Service" Issue

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The headed Playwright test revealed the actual issue:

```
üìã Strategy 1: Found 0 template cards with cursor-pointer
‚ö†Ô∏è Could not select any template
```

## ‚ùå This is NOT a Regression!

The "Failed to create service" error is **expected behavior** when:
- No templates exist in the database
- The service creation wizard requires at least one template to be selected
- Without templates, the wizard cannot proceed to create a service

## ‚úÖ Solution: Upload Templates First

Before running E2E tests or creating services, you must:

### Option 1: Manual Template Upload (Recommended for Testing)

1. Open: https://formgenai-4545.web.app/admin/templates
2. Click: "Upload Template" or "+ New Template"
3. Upload a .docx file (any Word document with placeholders like `{{fieldName}}`)
4. Wait for AI field extraction to complete
5. Save the template

### Option 2: Use Existing Templates

If you already have templates uploaded:
- Check they are in "active" status
- Verify they belong to your user account
- Ensure extracted fields are present

### Option 3: Seed Test Data (For Development)

```bash
# Run the seeding script (requires Firebase Admin credentials)
node scripts/seed-test-data.js
```

This creates 3 sample templates:
- Employment Contract (5 fields)
- NDA Agreement (4 fields)
- Service Agreement (6 fields)

## üìã E2E Test Requirements

The Playwright tests assume:
1. ‚úÖ User account exists (auto-created during test)
2. ‚ùå **At least 1 template exists** ‚Üê Missing!
3. ‚úÖ Firebase hosting is deployed
4. ‚úÖ Authentication works

## üéØ Test Flow

```
1. Login ‚úÖ
2. Navigate to service creation ‚úÖ
3. Fill service details ‚úÖ
4. Select template ‚ùå ‚Üê Fails here (no templates)
5. Send intake
6. Fill intake form
7. Generate document
8. Download document
```

## üêõ Debugging Output from Headed Test

From the visible browser test run:

```
üìù Wizard Step 2: Selecting templates...
üì∏ Screenshot: Wizard Step 2: Template Selection
üìã Strategy 1: Found 0 template cards with cursor-pointer
‚ö†Ô∏è Could not select any template
```

This confirms the page loaded correctly, but the templates list was empty.

## üîß Quick Fix for E2E Tests

1. **Upload one template manually** via UI
2. **Re-run the E2E tests:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test tests/core-scenarios.spec.ts --headed --project=chromium
   ```
3. Tests should now progress past the template selection step

## üìä Expected Test Results After Fix

Before (with no templates):
- ‚ùå Scenario 1: Create Account - Fails at template selection
- ‚ùå Scenario 2: Login - Fails at template selection
- ‚ùå Scenario 3: Create Service - Fails at template selection
- ‚úÖ Scenario 4: Open Intake Link - Passes
- ‚úÖ Scenario 5: Fill Submit Form - Passes

After (with templates uploaded):
- ‚úÖ Scenario 1: Create Account - Should pass
- ‚úÖ Scenario 2: Login - Should pass  
- ‚úÖ Scenario 3: Create Service - Should pass
- ‚úÖ Scenario 4: Open Intake Link - Should pass
- ‚úÖ Scenario 5: Fill Submit Form - Should pass
- ‚úÖ Scenario 6: Approve Generate - Should pass
- ‚úÖ Scenario 7: Complete Workflow - Should pass

Target: **100% pass rate** (7/7 tests passing)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Upload at least one .docx template via the admin UI
2. Re-run headed tests to verify service creation works
3. Consider creating a test data fixture for CI/CD

## üí° Prevention for Future

Add to test setup (in `tests/setup.ts` or similar):
```typescript
beforeAll(async () => {
  // Check if templates exist
  const templatesCount = await db.collection('templates').count().get();
  if (templatesCount.data().count === 0) {
    throw new Error('‚ùå No templates found! Upload at least one template before running E2E tests.');
  }
});
```

This will fail fast with a clear error message instead of mysterious "failed to create service" errors.
