- [ ] Test on different browsers
- [ ] Monitor Firebase Console for errors

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Firebase Console Links
- **Hosting:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/formgenai-4545/hosting
- **Functions:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/formgenai-4545/functions
- **Firestore:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/formgenai-4545/firestore
- **Storage:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/formgenai-4545/storage
- **Authentication:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/formgenai-4545/authentication
- **Logs:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/formgenai-4545/logs

### Key Metrics to Watch
- Function invocation count
- Function error rate
- Firestore read/write counts
- Storage usage
- Authentication success rate
- Page load times

---

## Cost Considerations

### Current Plan: Spark (Free Tier)
- **Hosting:** 10 GB bandwidth/month (free)
- **Functions:** 125K invocations, 40K GB-seconds/month (free)
- **Firestore:** 50K reads, 20K writes, 20K deletes/day (free)
- **Storage:** 1 GB storage, 1 GB downloads/day (free)
- **Authentication:** Unlimited users (free)

### Estimated Usage (Small Beta)
- **5-10 users:** Well within free tier
- **~100 documents/month:** Minimal function usage
- **Estimated cost:** $0/month

### When to Upgrade to Blaze (Pay-as-you-go)
- More than 20-30 active users
- More than 500 documents/month
- Need longer function timeouts
- Need more storage/bandwidth

   - Improve UX issues
   - Add requested features

6. **Optional: Add E2E Tests**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Run tests before each deployment
   - Target: 70%+ test coverage

### Medium Term (Next Month)
7. **Scale Considerations**
   - Monitor costs as usage grows
   - Optimize function performance
   - Consider CDN for assets
   - Plan for Blaze upgrade if needed

8. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Based on MVP instruction pack
   - Implement remaining features
   - Polish AI capabilities
   - Improve email notifications

## Known Limitations

### Performance
- **Cold Starts:** First visit may take 3-5 seconds (Cloud Function cold start)
- **Warm Responses:** Subsequent visits <1 second
- **Solution:** Cloud Run keeps function warm after initial traffic

### Scalability
- **Free Tier Limits:** Good for beta, may need upgrade for production scale
- **Function Timeout:** 60 seconds on Spark plan (may need more for large docs)
- **Solution:** Upgrade to Blaze plan when needed

### Browser Support
- **Modern Browsers Only:** Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari (latest versions)
- **IE11:** Not supported
- **Solution:** Display browser upgrade message for old browsers
