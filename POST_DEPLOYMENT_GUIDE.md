## 🚨 IMPORTANT: First Steps

### You MUST Do This to See the Changes:

Since you reported not seeing the invites on your dashboard, this is likely due to **browser cache**. Here's what to do:

1. **Hard Refresh the Page** (Most Important!)
   - **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - **Windows**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Or click the refresh button while holding Shift

2. **If that doesn't work**, clear your browser cache:
   - **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + Delete`
   - **Windows**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - Select "Last hour" and clear cache

3. **If still not working**, log out and log back in:
   - Sign out of the app completely
   - Close the browser tab
   - Open a new tab and sign in again

4. **Use the Debug Page** to verify data:
   - Visit: https://formgenai-4545.web.app/debug-team.html
   - Click "Check Firestore Data"
   - This will show you the raw data from the database

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still Not Seeing Invites?

1. **Check the debug page**:
   - Visit: https://formgenai-4545.web.app/debug-team.html
   - Click "Check Firestore Data"
   - Verify it shows: "Invites Sent: 1"

2. **Check browser console**:
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for any errors (red text)
   - Take a screenshot and share if you see errors

3. **Verify you're logged in as the admin**:
   - Email should be: belal.riyad@gmail.com
   - You should have the admin account card at the top

4. **Try a different browser**:
   - Open Chrome/Firefox/Safari in incognito/private mode
   - Log in again
   - Check if you see the invites

### Password Reset Not Working?

If you get "Permission denied" when trying to reset passwords:
1. Log out completely
2. Close all browser tabs
3. Open a new tab and log back in
4. Try the password reset again

This is because your authentication token needs to refresh to include the latest permissions.

## 🗂️ Data Verification (Already Confirmed)

We ran a diagnostic script that confirmed your Firestore data is correct:

```
✅ Found 2 team member(s)

👤 Member 1 (briyad@gmail.com)
   Status: ✅ Active
   Invite: ⚠️ Not sent
   Created: 10/20/2025, 8:21:31 AM

👤 Member 2 (briyad@gmail.com)
   Status: ✅ Active
   Invite: ✉️ Sent on 10/20/2025, 8:46:28 AM  ← This is the invite you sent!
   Created: 10/20/2025, 8:46:28 AM

📊 Summary:
   Total Members: 2
   Invites Sent: 1  ← This should display in the UI now
   Active: 2
```

So the data **IS** in the database - you just need to refresh your browser to see it!
