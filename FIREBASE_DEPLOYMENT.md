# 🔥 Firebase Deployment Guide

**Why Firebase Hosting?**
- ✅ Already using Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- ✅ Automatic environment variable inheritance
- ✅ No need to reconfigure env vars
- ✅ Integrated with your Firebase project
- ✅ Free tier includes SSL + CDN

---

## 🚀 Quick Deploy (3 commands)

```bash
# 1. Login to Firebase
firebase login

# 2. Build the app
npm run build

# 3. Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**That's it!** Your app will be live at:
`https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.web.app`

---

## 📋 Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Firebase Login
```bash
firebase login
```
- Opens browser for authentication
- Uses your Google account
- One-time setup

### Step 2: Verify Configuration
Your `firebase.json` is already configured for Next.js:
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "source": ".",
    "frameworksBackend": {
      "region": "us-central1"
    }
  }
}
```

This automatically:
- ✅ Detects Next.js framework
- ✅ Builds your app
- ✅ Deploys static + dynamic routes
- ✅ Sets up Cloud Functions for API routes
- ✅ Uses your existing Firebase env vars

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

This will:
1. Build your Next.js app (`npm run build`)
2. Upload static files to Firebase Hosting
3. Deploy API routes as Cloud Functions
4. Return your production URL

**Time:** 3-5 minutes

## 🎯 Environment Variables

### Good News! 
Firebase hosting automatically has access to:
- ✅ All Firebase credentials (already configured in project)
- ✅ Your `.env.local` file (for local dev)
- ✅ Firebase project settings (for production)

### For Production Secrets (OpenAI, etc.)
Add to Firebase Functions config:
```bash
# Set OpenAI API key
firebase functions:config:set openai.key="your_openai_key"

# View current config
firebase functions:config:get

# Deploy config
firebase deploy --only functions
```

Or use `.env.production` file (simpler):
```bash
# Create .env.production
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key" >> .env.production

# Firebase will use this in production
```

---

## 🧪 Test Before Production

### Deploy to Preview Channel
```bash
# Create a preview deployment
firebase hosting:channel:deploy preview

# Returns a preview URL:
# https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID--preview-RANDOM.web.app
```

Test the preview URL, then promote to production:
```bash
firebase hosting:channel:deploy live
```

---

## 📊 Post-Deployment

### Your URLs
- **Production:** `https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.web.app`
- **Firebase Console:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/hosting

### Monitoring
- **Hosting Metrics:** Firebase Console → Hosting
- **Function Logs:** Firebase Console → Functions
- **Performance:** Firebase Console → Performance Monitoring

### Custom Domain (Optional)
```bash
# Add your domain in Firebase Console
# Hosting → Add custom domain
# Follow DNS setup instructions
```

---

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

### GitHub Actions (Automatic)
Create `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0
        with:
          repoToken: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
          firebaseServiceAccount: '${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}'
          channelId: live
          projectId: YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

## 🆚 Firebase vs Vercel

| Feature | Firebase | Vercel |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Setup Time | 3 min | 15 min (env vars) |
| Integration | Native (already using) | External |
| Env Vars | Auto-inherited | Manual copy |
| Free Tier | Generous | Limited |
| Backend | Cloud Functions | Edge Functions |
| SSL/CDN | Included | Included |
| Monitoring | Firebase Console | Vercel Dashboard |

**Recommendation:** Use Firebase since you're already using it! 🔥

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build fails during deployment
```bash
# Test build locally first
npm run build

# Check for errors
# Fix any TypeScript/build errors
```

### Issue: API routes return 500
```bash
# Check function logs
firebase functions:log

# Common issue: Environment variables
# Add to .env.production or functions:config
```

### Issue: Firebase CLI not found
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Or use npx
npx firebase deploy --only hosting
```
