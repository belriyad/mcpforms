# 🔒 Data Isolation & Ownership Implementation

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Deployed

---

## 🎯 Overview

Implemented strict data isolation ensuring **each user only sees their own data**. No sharing of templates, services, intake forms, or any other data between users.

---

## 🔐 Security Changes

### Updated Firestore Security Rules

**Key Principle:** All data is **owned by the user who created it**.

#### Before (Insecure)
```javascript
// ❌ ANY lawyer/admin could see ALL data
match /templates/{templateId} {
  allow read: if isLawyerOrAdmin();  // Bad!
  allow create: if isLawyerOrAdmin();
}
```

#### After (Secure)
```javascript
// ✅ Users can ONLY see their own data
match /templates/{templateId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && 
                 (resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid || isAdmin());
  allow create: if isLawyerOrAdmin() && 
                   request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## 📋 Updated Collections

### 1. **Templates Collection**
```
Access Rules:
- ✅ Users can read ONLY their own templates
- ✅ Users can create templates (createdBy = their UID)
- ✅ Users can update/delete ONLY their own templates
- ✅ Admins can see all templates (admin override)

Required Field: createdBy (user UID)
```

### 2. **Services Collection**
```
Access Rules:
- ✅ Users can read ONLY their own services
- ✅ Users can create services (createdBy = their UID)
- ✅ Users can update/delete ONLY their own services
- ✅ Clients can read via token (special case)
- ✅ Admins can see all services (admin override)

Required Field: createdBy (user UID)
```

### 3. **Intake Customizations**
```
Access Rules:
- ✅ Users can read ONLY their own customizations
- ✅ Users can create customizations (userId = their UID)
- ✅ Users can update/delete ONLY their own customizations
- ✅ Admins can see all customizations (admin override)

Required Field: userId (user UID)
```

### 4. **Activity Logs**
```
Access Rules:
- ✅ Users can read ONLY their own activity logs
- ✅ Users can create logs (userId = their UID)
- ✅ Only admins can update/delete logs

Required Field: userId (user UID)
```

## 💻 Frontend Changes

### Component Updates

#### 1. **AdminDashboard.tsx**
```typescript
// ✅ Now filters by current user
const templatesQuery = query(
  collection(db, 'templates'),
  where('createdBy', '==', user.uid)  // Filter by user
)
```

#### 2. **ServiceManager.tsx**
```typescript
// ✅ Now filters by current user
const servicesQuery = query(
  collection(db, 'services'),
  where('createdBy', '==', user.uid)  // Filter by user
)
```

#### 3. **TemplateManager.tsx**
```typescript
// ✅ Now filters by current user
const templatesQuery = query(
  collection(db, 'templates'),
  where('createdBy', '==', user.uid)  // Filter by user
)
```

#### 4. **TemplateUpload.tsx**
```typescript
// ✅ Now adds createdBy field
const templateData = {
  name: templateName,
  // ... other fields
  createdBy: user?.uid,  // Owner UID
  createdAt: new Date()
}
```

#### 5. **CreateServicePage.tsx**
```typescript
// ✅ Now filters templates by user
const templatesQuery = query(
  collection(db, 'templates'),
  where('status', '==', 'parsed'),
  where('createdBy', '==', user.uid)  // Only user's templates
)

// ✅ Now includes createdBy in service creation
const serviceData = {
  name: serviceName,
  // ... other fields
  createdBy: user?.uid  // Owner UID
}
```

---

## 🔧 API Changes

### Service Creation API

**File:** `src/app/api/services/create/route.ts`

```typescript
// ✅ Now validates createdBy field
if (!body.createdBy) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Missing createdBy field - user must be authenticated' },
    { status: 401 }
  )
}

// ✅ Uses createdBy from request
const serviceData = {
  // ... fields
  createdBy: body.createdBy,  // From authenticated user
}
```

### Type Updates

**File:** `src/types/service.ts`

```typescript
export interface CreateServiceRequest {
  name: string
  clientName: string
  clientEmail: string
  templateIds: string[]
  createdBy: string  // ✅ Added - required user UID
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Data Isolation

### Test Scenario 1: Create Test Users

```bash
# 1. Create User A
Email: usera@test.com
Password: Test123!

# 2. Create User B
Email: userb@test.com
Password: Test123!
```

### Test Scenario 2: Upload Templates

```
1. Login as User A
2. Upload template: "Template A"
3. Logout

4. Login as User B
5. Upload template: "Template B"
6. ✅ Should NOT see "Template A"
7. ✅ Should ONLY see "Template B"
```

### Test Scenario 3: Create Services

```
1. Login as User A
2. Create service with "Template A"
3. Logout

4. Login as User B
5. Go to services page
6. ✅ Should NOT see User A's service
7. ✅ Should ONLY see own services
```

### Test Scenario 4: Dashboard Stats

```
1. Login as User A
2. Note counts: 1 template, 1 service

3. Login as User B
4. ✅ Counts should be: 1 template, 0 services
5. ✅ Should NOT include User A's data
```

---

## 📊 Admin Override

Admins have special permissions to see all data:

```javascript
function isAdmin() {
  return isAuthenticated() && 
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
}

// Admins can see everything
allow read: if isAuthenticated() && 
               (resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid || isAdmin());
```

**Admin capabilities:**
- ✅ View all users' templates
- ✅ View all users' services
- ✅ View all users' customizations
- ✅ View all activity logs
- ✅ Manage all data

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Migration Required

**Existing data without `createdBy` field will be inaccessible!**

If you have existing templates/services in production:

```javascript
// Run this migration script (create as needed)
const migrateData = async () => {
  // Get all templates without createdBy
  const templates = await getDocs(query(
    collection(db, 'templates'),
    where('createdBy', '==', null)
  ))
  
  // Assign to a default user or current admin
  for (const doc of templates.docs) {
    await updateDoc(doc.ref, {
      createdBy: 'default-admin-uid' // Replace with actual UID
    })
  }
}
```

### Required Fields Checklist

When creating new documents, **always include**:

- ✅ `createdBy` (user UID) for templates
- ✅ `createdBy` (user UID) for services
- ✅ `userId` (user UID) for customizations
- ✅ `userId` (user UID) for activity logs

---

## 🎯 Data Flow

### Template Upload Flow

```
1. User logs in → Gets user.uid
2. Uploads template
3. Frontend adds createdBy: user.uid
4. Firestore rules verify: request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid
5. ✅ Template saved with owner
6. Future queries filter: where('createdBy', '==', user.uid)
```

### Service Creation Flow

```
1. User logs in → Gets user.uid
2. Selects templates (only sees their own)
3. Creates service
4. Frontend adds createdBy: user.uid
5. API validates createdBy field exists
6. Service saved with owner
7. ✅ Only owner can see/edit service
```

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### ✅ What's Protected

- User A cannot see User B's templates
- User A cannot see User B's services
- User A cannot see User B's intake customizations
- User A cannot see User B's activity logs
- All queries automatically filter by logged-in user

### ⚠️ What to Watch

- Ensure all new features add `createdBy` field
- Ensure all queries filter by `user.uid`
- Test with multiple user accounts
- Admin users can see all data (by design)

---

## 🧪 Verification Commands

### Check Firestore Rules
